## Test Data and Mocking

### Mock Data
- Test users with various scenarios (valid, duplicate, unverified)
- Mock API responses for all endpoints
- Simulated browser environments and storage APIs
- Cross-browser compatibility scenarios

### Environment Setup
- Automatic cleanup between tests
- Isolated test environments
- Mock implementations for external dependencies
- Configurable test data for different scenarios

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### E2E Test Failures
1. **Browser not installed**: Run `npx playwright install`
2. **Dev server not starting**: Check port availability and dependencies
3. **Timeout errors**: Increase timeout values in playwright.config.ts
4. **Element not found**: Update selectors or add wait conditions

#### Integration Test Failures
1. **Mock setup issues**: Verify mock implementations match actual APIs
2. **Async timing issues**: Use proper async/await patterns
3. **State cleanup**: Ensure proper beforeEach/afterEach cleanup

### Debugging Tools
- Playwright Test UI: `npm run test:e2e:ui`
- Jest watch mode: `npm run test:watch`
- Coverage reports: `npm run test:coverage`
- Browser developer tools for E2E debugging

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Integration
```yaml
# Example CI configuration
- name: Run Tests
  run: |
    npm test
    npm run test:e2e
```

### Test Reporting
- HTML reports for Playwright tests
- Coverage reports for Jest tests
- Performance metrics tracking
- Security vulnerability scanning

## Contributing

### Adding New Tests
1. Follow existing test structure and naming conventions
2. Include both positive and negative test cases
3. Add proper documentation and comments
4. Ensure tests are isolated and repeatable
5. Update this README with new test coverage

### Test Guidelines
- Write descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Use proper setup and teardown for test isolation
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Include edge cases and error scenarios
- Validate both functionality and security aspects

## Performance Benchmarks

### Target Metrics
- **Page Load Time**: < 3 seconds
- **API Response Time**: < 2 seconds (signin), < 3 seconds (registration)
- **Form Validation**: < 10ms per field
- **Memory Usage**: < 50MB increase during auth flow
- **Bundle Size**: < 500KB for auth-related code

### Monitoring
Tests include performance assertions that will fail if metrics exceed targets, ensuring performance regressions are caught early in development.
