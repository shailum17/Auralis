# Wellness Data Cleanup Summary

## Overview
I've successfully removed all hardcoded wellness data and implemented a proper user-driven wellness system that only shows data that users have actually entered.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Hardcoded Data (`apps/web/src/app/wellness/page.tsx`)

**Before:**
- Hardcoded `moodData` array with fake mood, energy, and stress values
- Hardcoded `wellnessGoals` array with fake progress data
- Hardcoded wellness score (78%), day streak (7), and activities count (12)

**After:**
- Dynamic data fetching based on user's actual wellness entries
- Empty states when no data is available
- Proper loading and error handling

### 2. Created Wellness Data Hook (`apps/web/src/hooks/useWellnessData.ts`)

**Features:**
- **Real API Integration**: Fetches actual user wellness data from backend
- **Conditional Loading**: Only loads data if user has wellness tracking enabled
- **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript interfaces for all wellness data
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback
- **CRUD Operations**: Add mood entries, update goals, refresh data

**Data Types:**
- `MoodEntry`: User's daily mood, energy, and stress ratings
- `WellnessGoal`: User-defined wellness goals with progress tracking
- `WellnessStats`: Calculated statistics from user's actual data

### 3. Created Wellness Onboarding (`apps/web/src/components/wellness/WellnessOnboarding.tsx`)

**Purpose:**
- Shows when user hasn't enabled wellness tracking
- Allows users to choose which wellness features to enable
- Respects user privacy - no forced tracking
- Updates user's wellness settings in database

**Features:**
- **Feature Selection**: Users choose what to track (mood, stress, insights, crisis alerts)
- **Privacy First**: Clear privacy notice and user control
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Users can enable more features later
- **Proper Integration**: Updates user context and refreshes data

### 4. Updated Wellness Page Logic

**Conditional Rendering:**
- Shows onboarding if wellness tracking is disabled
- Shows empty states when no data is available
- Shows actual data when user has entries
- Proper loading states during data fetching

**User Experience:**
- No fake data or misleading information
- Clear calls-to-action for users to start tracking
- Helpful empty states that guide users
- Proper error handling and recovery

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Data Integrity**
- ✅ No more fake or placeholder data
- ✅ Only shows data users have actually entered
- ✅ Clear distinction between "no data" and "loading"

### 2. **User Privacy**
- ✅ Users must explicitly enable wellness tracking
- ✅ Granular control over what data to track
- ✅ Can disable tracking at any time
- ✅ Clear privacy notices and user consent

### 3. **Proper State Management**
- ✅ Loading states during API calls
- ✅ Error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ Automatic data refresh after changes
- ✅ Optimistic updates for better UX

### 4. **Type Safety**
- ✅ Full TypeScript support for all wellness data
- ✅ Proper interfaces for API responses
- ✅ Type-safe CRUD operations
- ✅ Compile-time error checking

## API Endpoints Expected

The wellness system expects these backend endpoints:

```
GET /wellness/mood-entries     - Fetch user's mood entries
POST /wellness/mood-entries    - Add new mood entry
GET /wellness/goals           - Fetch user's wellness goals
PUT /wellness/goals/:id       - Update wellness goal
GET /wellness/stats           - Fetch calculated wellness statistics
```

## User Flow

### New Users (No Wellness Tracking)
1. Visit wellness page → See onboarding
2. Choose wellness features to enable
3. Save preferences → Enable tracking
4. Start logging wellness data

### Existing Users (With Tracking Enabled)
1. Visit wellness page → See their actual data
2. View charts based on their mood entries
3. Track progress on their personal goals
4. See statistics calculated from their data

### Users With No Data Yet
1. Visit wellness page → See empty states
2. Clear calls-to-action to start logging
3. Helpful guidance on what to track
4. Easy access to logging features

## Benefits

1. **Authentic Experience**: Users see their real wellness journey
2. **Privacy Compliant**: No data collection without explicit consent
3. **Motivating**: Real progress tracking encourages continued use
4. **Flexible**: Users control what they want to track
5. **Scalable**: Easy to add new wellness features
6. **Maintainable**: Clean separation of concerns and proper error handling

## Next Steps

To complete the wellness system:

1. **Backend Implementation**: Create the wellness API endpoints
2. **Data Visualization**: Enhance charts with more wellness metrics
3. **Goal Setting**: Add UI for users to create and modify wellness goals
4. **Insights Engine**: Implement AI-powered wellness insights
5. **Notifications**: Add wellness reminders and alerts
6. **Export Features**: Allow users to export their wellness data

The frontend is now ready to work with a proper wellness tracking system that respects user privacy and only displays authentic, user-generated data.
